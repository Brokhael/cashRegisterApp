# Cash Register ðŸ’°ðŸ›’
This project implements a simple cash register that can add productos to a cart and calculate the total price of the purchase, following certain pricing rules.
## Project description:
### The cash register consists of the following main classes:

- **Product**: Represents a product with a unique code, name and price
- **PricingRules**: Contains the pricing rules applied to the products:
  - BOGOF: Buy one, get one free

    - Constants are used to determine the prices in special cases
    - For strawberries if you have 3 or more the price of each of them is reduced to 4.50 instead of 5
    - For coffee if you have 3 or more the price of each coffee is reduced to 2/3 of the original price.
